PIt is from the footprint that the attacker obtains essential information for the success of an invasion, such as the network topology, domain names and the operating system used (fingerprint). The intention is to create a profile of your target host to try to discover flaws and possible loopholes that can be exploited from default settings and passwords. The footprint is nothing more than the detailed search for as much information as possible about the target of the invasion, trying to circumvent, if possible, IDS tools or firewalls.

Some common footprint targets are:
» Domain names;

» Responsible for the domains;

» Servers that are part of the domain;

» Identification of the target host's operating system (fingerprint);

» Network subnets; » TCP and UDP services available;

» Network topology;

» Usernames and group names;

» Banners that identify service versions or even the version the operating system;

» Routing tables;

» Servers hidden by NAT through packet TTL analysis;

» E-mail addresses, mainly those of administrators;

» E-mail accounts, FTP and other services;

» Information on misconfigured SNMP services;

» Domain of the organization and the hosts that compose it;

» IP ranges of the domain;

» Security structure (existence of firewall and/or IDS);

» Router identification.
