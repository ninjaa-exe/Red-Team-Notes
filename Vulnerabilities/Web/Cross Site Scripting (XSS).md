## Reflected 
Using the same concept as HTML Injection, it is also possible to inject javascript code into the server to execute code on the server. Reflected XSS is because the attacker creates a malicious URL and needs to send it to a victim, no write is made to the page's database

## Stored 
When XSS is stored somewhere, for example feedback comments, it is possible to steal other users' cookies by sending them to the server itself
