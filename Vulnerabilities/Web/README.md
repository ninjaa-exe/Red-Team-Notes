# Basic Informations
## URL Encode
URL encoding converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.

URLs can only be sent over the Internet using theÂ [ASCII character-set](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp).

Since URLs often contain characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted into a valid ASCII format.

URL encoding replaces unsafe ASCII characters with a "%" followed by two hexadecimal digits.  

URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign or with %20.
