File and directory brute force is a common technique used by cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers to uncover hidden resources on web servers. This technique involves using automated tools to send a large amount of HTTP requests to the server, trying to identify directories and files that are not easily accessible through conventional browsing.

Brute forcing files and directories on web servers involves using automated tools to send a series of HTTP requests, based on user-provided keywords, with the goal of uncovering hidden resources. These requests are analyzed to determine if the requested resource is available on the server. At the end of the process, a report is generated, listing the directories and files found, making it possible to identify possible security vulnerabilities or exposure of sensitive information.
